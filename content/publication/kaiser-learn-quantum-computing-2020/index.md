abstract: "Learn Quantum Computing with Python and Q# demystifies quantum computing. Using Python and the new quantum programming language Q#, you'll learn QC fundamentals as you apply quantum programming techniques to real-world examples including cryptography and chemical analysis. Learn Quantum Computing with Python and Q# builds your understanding of quantum computers, using Microsoft's Quantum Development Kit to abstract away the mathematical complexities. You'll learn QC basics as you create your own quantum simulator in Python, then move on to using the QDK and the new Q# language for writing and running algorithms very different to those found in classical computing. Purchase of the print book includes a free eBook in PDF, Kindle, and ePub formats from Manning Publications."
