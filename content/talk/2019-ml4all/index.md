abstract: "In the rush to add the word _quantum_ to everything from batteries to banking, Quantum machine learning has entered the fray. A perfect combination of buzzwords that will get all of the funding....right? In this talk I want to look at: quantum computers are and how you program one. With this context, we can look at what machine learning tasks are being explored for possible speedups with quantum computing."
