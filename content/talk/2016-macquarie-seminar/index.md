summary:
abstract: "Long-distance quantum communication systems are of interest for commercial and fundamental scientific projects. Commercially available Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) devices that claim physical security of generated keys rely on telecom fiber networks to link communicating parties. This talk will address two main aspects to making QKD devices practical: satellites can be used to extend the range of the QKD devices past the current limit of ~200km, and all current implementations of QKD are insecure due to hardware vulnerabilities. I will also identify remaining challenges for practical long distance quantum communication."
